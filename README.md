## Usage
Optionally run `scrapy crawl cuckoo_start` once first to get the max/start id written to a .txt file called max_id.txt. Alternatively, this file can be created manually. It should contain the id from which you want the crawler to start from (it will then decrement this id by 1 to fetch additional reports).

`scrapy crawl cuckoo -a amount_to_fetch=5 -s JOBDIR=crawls/cuckoo-7 -s LOG_FILE=./logs/cuckoo-7.log`
JOBDIR to save state between runs and filter out duplicate requests.
LOG_FILE to log to file instead of console.
amount_to_fetch specififes how many reports should be downloaded in this run.
